                        <h3>Membership and Subscription</h3>
                        <p>ClubRXPro provides its services through a membership model that allows subscribers to access a variety of healthcare benefits, including prescription medications at reduced costs. The membership is structured into different subscription tiers, catering to individual needs and family plans:</p>

                        <h5><strong>2. Family Membership:</strong> This plan is tailored for single users who require ongoing access to medications. It provides a convenient way to manage and refill prescriptions, ensuring continuous and affordable care.</h5>
                        <h5><strong>1. Individual Membership:</strong> Designed for families, this plan covers multiple members under a single subscription, offering an efficient and economical approach to managing the healthcare needs of the entire household.</h5>

                        <p>Membership in either plan grants access to essential services such as automatic prescription refills, comprehensive medication management, and personalized support. Subscribers are required to pay a one-time initiation fee, followed by recurring monthly payments. These payments cover the cost of the services provided and ensure uninterrupted access to your prescribed medications and other benefits included in the membership.</p>
